                            <p>{`I started dabbling in software engineering during college, mostly when working in a research lab. There, I got my hands dirty with application development, mainly focused on signal processing and visualization, using tools like Matlab and Python. After college, I moved to New York City and joined a startup. My work there was a mix of lab stuff and more techy tasks like developing SQL schema for tracking metadata.`}</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>{`My career path shifted over time, moving from lab work to full-blown software development. This change led me to work on some cool Open Source projects, like `}<a href="#Docketeer (Open Source Product)" className="text-teal-300 hover:text-teal-100">Docketeer</a>.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>{`When I'm not coding, I keep things balanced with physical and creative hobbies. I'm into Muay Thai and playing guitar â€“ they're great ways to unwind and balance out my work life.`}</p>
